# AI Programming Projects

This repository captures two Udacity mini-projects that reinforce core Python and deep-learning workflows.

- **create_your_own_image_classifier** – uses PyTorch to train a flower classifier from scratch. The folder already includes its own README with full setup and usage instructions.
- **image_classification_city_dog_show** – adapts a provided pre-trained classifier (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet) to validate dog-show registrations, reporting accuracy and timing for each model. See that project's README for details and batch scripts.

Both projects share the same environment setup (Conda + PyTorch). Refer to each subdirectory for step-by-step notebooks, scripts, and deliverables.
